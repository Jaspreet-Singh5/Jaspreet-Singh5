# Hi, I'm Jaspreet Singh

I am a fresher looking for as many opportunities as I can in order to enhance my experience. I have worked on a lot of projects especially in the fields of web development, python and android development. I have a craze for competitive programming. I am always looking for new ideas to help solve the problems around me. Recently, I have worked on some sites for the fests of our department in our college.
Last but not the least, I am very passionate about my work and have a lot of different ideas that I can share with the management of the company hiring me and could help in their growth somehow.  |  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jaspreet-Singh5/Jaspreet-Singh5/master/Jaspreet-Singh5.png)
